### üìù Pending Tasks

#### Phase 1: Analysis Development
- [ ] **Create Button Press Handler Analysis** (Priority: HIGH)
  - [ ] Create analysis to detect button press types
  - [ ] Implement payload parsing for WS101
  - [ ] Add press type routing logic
  - [ ] Test with sample button data

- [ ] **Analysis Testing** (Priority: HIGH)
  - [ ] Test DMX controller analysis independently
  - [ ] Verify command encoding and downlink
  - [ ] Test each command type separately
  - [ ] Validate hex encoding format

#### Phase 2: Action Creation
- [ ] **Create TagoIO Action** (Priority: MEDIUM)
  - [ ] Create action triggered by button device data
  - [ ] Configure trigger conditions for each press type
  - [ ] Link action to DMX controller analysis
  - [ ] Test action trigger functionality

- [ ] **Action Testing** (Priority: MEDIUM)
  - [ ] Test button press detection
  - [ ] Verify action triggers correctly
  - [ ] Test complete button-to-light flow
  - [ ] Validate command routing

#### Phase 3: Integration & Testing
- [ ] **End-to-End Testing** (Priority: MEDIUM)
  - [ ] Test with physical WS101 button
  - [ ] Verify DMX light responses
  - [ ] Test all button press types
  - [ ] Validate error handling

- [ ] **Performance Optimization** (Priority: LOW)
  - [ ] Optimize analysis execution time
  - [ ] Reduce command latency
  - [ ] Add monitoring and alerts

#### Phase 4: Documentation & Deployment
- [ ] **Final Documentation** (Priority: LOW)
  - [ ] Update README with final implementation
  - [ ] Create deployment guide
  - [ ] Document troubleshooting procedures
  - [ ] Create maintenance guide

## üéØ Current Focus

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Create DMX Controller Analysis Script**
   - Implement command sending functionality
   - Use ChirpStack codec for encoding
   - Test with sample commands

2. **Test Analysis Independently**
   - Verify command encoding
   - Test downlink functionality
   - Validate hex format

### Success Criteria
- [ ] DMX controller analysis can send all three command types
- [ ] Commands are properly encoded in hex format
- [ ] Analysis executes without errors
- [ ] Downlink messages are sent to correct device

---

## üêõ Known Issues
- None currently identified

## üìù Notes
- WS101 button supports single, long, and double press (no triple press)
- Commands must be encoded in hex format for ChirpStack
- fPort should remain 1 for all communications
- Both devices share same Tago device ID but different TTN device IDs

## üîß Technical Requirements

### Analysis Requirements
- Node.js runtime
- TagoIO SDK integration
- ChirpStack codec integration
- Error handling and logging
- Hex encoding for downlink

### Action Requirements
- Device data trigger
- Conditional execution based on button press type
- Analysis execution integration
- Error handling

### Testing Requirements
- Independent analysis testing
- Action trigger testing
- End-to-end integration testing
- Error scenario testing
